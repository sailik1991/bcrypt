# bcrypt

This is a java implementation of bcrypt built with ANT build logic.  Publication for the algorithm can be found [here](http://www.openbsd.org/papers/bcrypt-paper.pdf).

The implementation is exactly the same as mentioned in the paper, in contrast to some more popular libraries out there.  The encode and decode in base-64 is same as the original implementation (in [C](http://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-crypto/2002/05/24/msg000204.html)) by  Niels Provos.

Feel free to use the code in this repository.  You might want to check the LICENSE.md file for checking the MIT LICENSE.
